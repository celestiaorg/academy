## Smart contracts on rollups

If you're a developer who wants to deploy a smart contract on a rollup,
you've come to the right place! In the first part of Modular Academy,
we'll learn about the different types of smart contracts you can deploy
on a rollup.

We'll start by learning how to deploy an ERC-721 smart contract on a rollup. Then we'll learn how to mint
an ERC-1155 on the rollup by using our ERC-721 as a prerequisite for minting.

Get started with module 1. This will show you how to
create an ERC-721 smart contract on OP Celestia Raspberry testnet.
