## post about it

congratulations ðŸŽ‰ you've just deployed a contract, and minted an ERC-721 NFT on a rollup!

now, let's share your accomplishment with the world. post a tweet with a screenshot of your NFT and a link to your thirdweb NFT dashboard.

if you're not feeling like a tweeter today, that's okay too. just make sure to drop a message in the telegram chat to let everyone know what you've built.

here's an example message you can copy and paste:

## submit your module

submit your EVM address and a link to the mint transaction and we'll send you an NFT as a momento of finishing your first module on your journey in the modular academy.
