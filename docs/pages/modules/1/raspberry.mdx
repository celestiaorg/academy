# Getting set up with Raspberry

## Install MetaMask

First, install [download MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download) if you don't have it already.

## Add Raspberry to your wallet

Now you can add Raspberry testnet as a chain in MetaMask from [the Raspberry testnet page](https://raas.gelato.network/rollups/details/public/op-celestia-testnet).

## Get testnet Raspberry ETH

In order to deploy your first contract, you'll need some testnet ETH. You can get testnet ETH by clicking "Request Faucet Funds on Raspberry rollup" on the Raspberry testnet page. Just copy and paste your wallet address from MetaMask and request funds!

## Check the explorer for your ETH

Copy your address and paste it into the [Raspberry explorer](https://blockscout.op-celestia-testnet.gelato.digital/) to see your balance.

## Ready to write a contract

Now you're ready to write your first contract on Raspberry testnet. Let's get started!
