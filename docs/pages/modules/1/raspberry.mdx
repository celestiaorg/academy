# getting set up with Raspberry

::::steps
## install MetaMask

first, install [download MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download) if you don't have it already.
follow the instructions to set up your wallet and do not share your mnemonic with anyone. this mnemonic (a.k.a. recovery phrase) is the key to your wallet and should always be kept secret.

## add OP Celestia Raspberry to your wallet

now you can add OP Celestia Raspberry testnet as a chain in MetaMask from [the OP Celestia Raspberry testnet page](https://raas.gelato.network/rollups/details/public/op-celestia-testnet)

## get testnet OP Celestia Raspberry ETH

in order to deploy your first contract, you'll need some testnet ETH. Visit a Sepolia faucet (like [this one](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia)) to obtain some Sepolia ETH. Use [the bridge on the OP Celestia Raspberry testnet page](https://bridge.gelato.network/bridge/opcelestia-raspberry) to then bridge your Sepolia ETH to the OP Celestia Raspberry testnet.

this process should only take a few minutes. once you're done, you should see your OP Celestia Raspberry ETH in your MetaMask wallet.
