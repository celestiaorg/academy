# Deploying your contract with thirdweb

In this page, we'll learn how to deploy a smart contract on thirdweb with no code. We'll be deploying an ERC-721 smart contract.

## Go to thirdweb.com

Visit [the thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).

## Connect your wallet

Connect your wallet to thirdweb.

After you connect your wallet, you'll need to sign a message to confirm that you are the owner of the wallet. Click sign in.

## Pick the contract to deploy

Click on the Deploy button on the dashboard.

This will take you to a page where you can pick the contract you want to deploy. Click "Ready-to-deploy".

Then click "NFT Drop" where you'll deploy an ERC-721 smart contract and mint your own token.

Read the contract page to understand more about the contract you're deploying.

## Deploy the contract

Click "Deploy now >>" to deploy the contract.

Fill in the details for your contract. We'll leave this exercise to you to complete. Add a photo if you want and check out the other options. Have fun!

:::tip
Make sure you're deploying to OP Celestia Raspberry in thirdweb.

You'll have 3 transactions to confirm. Confirm them all.

Congratulations! You've deployed your first smart contract on OP Celestia Raspberry with thirdweb and no code!

## Upload an NFT

After you're done deploying the contract, you'll need to upload an NFT to the contract.

For module 1, we'll do a "Single Upload" and upload one image. After you've uploaded your image and given it a name, description, and other details, click "Lazy Mint NFT".

After you've uploaded your NFT, your dashboard will look similar to this:

## Set claim conditions

Now you're ready to set claim conditions for your NFT. This is where we encourage you to have some fun with your projects. You can set the claim conditions to be anything you want. For example, you can set the claim conditions to be that the user must have a certain amount of $YOURTOKEN in their wallet to claim the NFT.

For this example, we're going to set an Only Owner phase for this token, so that you are the only one who can claim it.

Again, play around with the settings if you'd like. When you're ready, click "Save Phases".

After your transaction goes through, you'll see a currently active claim phase for "Only Owner".
