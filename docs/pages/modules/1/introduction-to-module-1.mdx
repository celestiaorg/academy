# Introduction to smart contract with verifiable randomness

Welcome to the world of rollups. If you're an Ethereum Virtual Machine
(EVM) developer, you might wonder how building on a rollup, like
[Bubs testnet](https://bubstestnet.com), compares to traditional blockchains.
The truth is, the experience is designed to be seamless, removing any
cognitive dissonance you might have about the differences between the two.

### What is a rollup?

A rollup is a layer 2 solution that processes and stores transaction data on a
separate chain, but ultimately settles it on a main blockchain like Ethereum.
In this case, Bubs testnet is an OP Stack rollup that settles on Ethereum and
posts data to Celestia for data availability.
This allows for faster and cheaper transactions without sacrificing security.
Think of it as building on a blockchain, but with the superpowers of
scalability and efficiency.

### Building on Bubs testnet

The Bubs testnet is a rollup that operates with the familiarity of the EVM,
making it an ideal playground for developers looking to explore the benefits
of rollups without straying too far from the Ethereum development environment
they know and love.

### Dive into development

Let's dive into a typical development scenario on a rollup: deploying ERC-721
and ERC-1155 smart contracts. These token standards are the backbone of many
decentralized applications, enabling the creation of unique (non-fungible)
and semi-fungible tokens, respectively.

#### ERC-721 on a rollup

Deploying an ERC-721 on a rollup is similar to deploying on Ethereum. However,
the added efficiency of rollups means you can expect faster transaction finality
and lower gas fees. This makes the minting process of unique tokens, such as
digital art or collectibles, more accessible and cost-effective.

#### Integrating verifiable randomness

A unique feature we'll explore is integrating a Verifiable Random Function (VRF)
with our smart contracts. VRFs provide a secure and verifiable way to generate
randomness, essential for many decentralized applications. For instance, a
gaming app can use a VRF to ensure fair and unpredictable outcomes.

We'll use a [drand-based VRF solution](https://chain.link/education-hub/verifiable-random-function-vrf)
compatible with the EVM. This allows us to incorporate secure randomness directly
into our smart contracts with familiar EVM opcodes.

#### ERC-1155: The multi-token standard

Next, we'll expand our application by deploying an ERC-1155 smart contract.
This standard allows for the efficient creation of both fungible and
non-fungible tokens within a single contract, opening up a world of
possibilities for developers.

By leveraging the capabilities of rollups and the versatility of the ERC-1155
standard, you can build complex, multi-faceted applications with ease.

### Conclusion

Building on a rollup like the Bubs testnet offers a familiar yet enhanced
development experience for EVM developers. By following this tutorial,
you'll learn how to deploy ERC-721 and ERC-1155 smart contracts and integrate a
VRF solution, all while enjoying the benefits of rollup technology.
