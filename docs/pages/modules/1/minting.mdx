# Mint your NFT on the Raspberry rollup

Now is time to mint your NFT.

For the sake of this module, we'll be using the embed to mint the NFT directly in the browser. Then we'll add it to your wallet so you can see it in the NFTs tab.

## Find your embed

Find the embed tab on the sidebar under "Extensions" for your contract.

It looks like this, but with your NFT.
