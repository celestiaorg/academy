## deploying a smart contract to an EVM rollup

welcome to the world of rollups! if you're an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) developer, you might wonder how building on a rollup, like [OP Celestia Raspberry testnet](https://raas.gelato.network/rollups/details/public/op-celestia-testnet), compares to traditional blockchains. the truth is, the experience is designed to be the same.

## what is OP Celestia Raspberry testnet?

Raspberry testnet is an OP Stack rollup that settles on Ethereum and posts data to Celestia for data availability. posting data to Celestia instead of as `calldata` on Ethereum allows for faster and cheaper transactions without sacrificing security.

## building on Raspberry testnet

the Raspberry testnet is a rollup that operates with the familiarity of the EVM, making it an ideal playground for developers looking to explore the benefits of rollups without straying too far from the Ethereum development environment they know and love.

## why should i use a rollup?

deploying an ERC-721 on a rollup is very similar to deploying on Ethereum. however, the added efficiency of rollups means you can expect faster transaction finality and lower gas fees. this makes the minting process of unique tokens, such as digital art, collectibles, or tokens for real world assets, more accessible and cost-effective.

where's the proof? [Syndicate's Frame Chain](https://warpcast.com/will/0x66826dd0) allows for just 0.01 ETH to cover many millions of transactions.

## ready to ship?

building on a rollup like the Raspberry testnet offers a familiar yet enhanced development experience for EVM developers. by following this tutorial, you'll learn how to deploy ERC-721 smart contract with no code, all while enjoying the benefits of rollup technology.
