## submit a blob, become a rollup

in this guide, we'll learn how to submit a blob and become our own rollup using Celestia.

## what is a blob?

a blob is a piece of data that can be submitted to a data availability layer. blobs are used to store rollup blocks.

### how do i submit a blob?

you can use a CLI, code, or even a block explorer to submit a blob to Celestia. Celenium allows you to submit blobs and sign them with keplr wallet.

## what is a rollup?

a rollup is blockchain that outsources one of its components to a separate chain. think of a rollup as a blockchain with the superpowers of scalability, efficiency, and verifiability by all.

### right, but how do i become a rollup?

to become a rollup, you need to submit a blob to Celestia containing some information about some other thing that your rollup keeps track of.

#### wait, what?

for example, if you want to become a rollup for a token, you would submit a blob containing information about the token's balances, transfers, and other relevant information.

you can rollup anything you want! from nfts, to what you had for lunch, to irl tickets, the possibilities are endless. literally endless. just hit next lol.
